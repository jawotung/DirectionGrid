# 5x5 Grid Object Visualizer

## Overview

The goal of this project is to create a React application that includes a component to visualize the placement of an object on a 5x5 grid (table). The position and direction of the object are determined by an input string with the format `"x,y direction"` (e.g., `"1,1 NORTH"`). 

The project uses **Material UI** for the user interface components and **Storybook** to document and demonstrate the functionality of the component.

### Key Features:
- **5x5 Grid Display**: A visual grid where the object’s position is displayed based on the input.
- **Position and Direction Control**: The object’s position and direction are determined by an input string (e.g., `"1,1 NORTH"`).
- **Material UI**: Utilizes Material UI components for a clean and responsive user interface.
- **Storybook**: Documenting the component using Storybook for development in isolation and visual testing.

## Technologies

- **React**: A JavaScript framework used to build the user interface.
- **Material UI**: A React component library to design the UI, offering customizable components with a modern, consistent design.
- **Storybook**: A tool for developing and documenting components in isolation, making it easier to test UI components and ensure reusability.

## 3. How to Run
Install dependencies by running pnpm install (or npm/yarn)

Run in dev mode by executing: pnpm run dev (or npm/yarn)

Run Storybook to view components in isolation: pnpm run storybook (or npm/yarn)
